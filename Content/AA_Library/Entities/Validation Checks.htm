        <h1>Validation Checks</h1>
        <p>When validation checks are performed, pControl performs a calculation. The output of this calculation is compared to <b class="BufferandFunctionBold">L200: Tolerance</b> values to determine if the result is acceptable, (within tolerance), or an exception is to be raised, i.e. tolerance has been breached.</p>
        <p>pControl can perform a number of validations at each stage of the process, these validations are described in <MadCap:xref href="NAV Process Phases and Functions.htm">Process Phases and Functions</MadCap:xref>.</p>
