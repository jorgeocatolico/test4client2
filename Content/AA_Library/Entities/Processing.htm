                <p>pControl processes are organised into processing phases which are executed in sequence. There are a number of activities performed in each phase, and the specific activities performed for an individual entity (portfolio, currency, benchmark) are determined by the configuration of an associated template.</p>
                <p>The following shows an example of the processing phases for a control record. Each process phase has a list of standard functions associated to it which can be configured through the process template.</p>
