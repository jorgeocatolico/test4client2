        <h1>CA - Investment Holdings and Internal Account Balances</h1>
        <h2 class="_orange">In Processing Mode</h2>
        <p>pControl maintains a number of balances for an entity based on the orders and transactions that have been processed.</p>
        <p>The key balances that are maintained and used by the Cash Allocation process are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Investment Holding Balances - pControl maintains the number of confirmed and pending units that an entity holds in each of its underlying investments so that these holdings can be valued at a point in time and the actual allocation percentage calculated. </p>
                <p>The investment holding balances for an entity can be seen through the 'Investment Holdings' view in pControl (Functions &gt; Balances &gt; Investment Holdings) as shown below. </p>

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Internal Account Balances - pControl maintains a balance for each of the internal 'ledger' accounts relevant for an entity. The internal accounts have a balance as at an effective date and this date can be in the past, present or future and will be based on the set of transactions currently approved in pControl. </p>
                <p>The ability to calculate a forward looking account balance in pControl is used in the cash allocation product to allow the liquidity balance calculation process to look forward and use future dated account balances if required.</p>
                <p>An example is shown below.</p>
