        <h1>Oversight Pool and Class Dependency</h1>
        <p>Some Oversight Classes are dependent on an Oversight Pool’s expected pricing processing completing and being approved, before their own process can be executed, or vice versa. pControl can manage this dependency via the ‘Pool / Class’ Relationship attribute on  the Oversight Class entity.</p>

        <div class="note_content">
            <p> Many class entities can be associated with a pool entity. Only one pool entity can be selected in the drop down menu on class entities.</p>
            <p>For entities other than ‘Oversight Pool’ and ‘Oversight Class’ entities, these dependencies are managed via the [AP040] Wait for dependent process(es) function.</p>
