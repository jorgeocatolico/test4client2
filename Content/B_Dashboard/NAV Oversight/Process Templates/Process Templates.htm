        <p>The Daily Pricing and Expected Pricing processes are based on a predefined set of operations that are represented on their respective process templates, and processing behaviour is driven by the configuration of these process templates together with the setting of attributes associated on the entity. The required validations that are performed for each pricing process are also defined on the process template.</p>
        <p>The process templates for Expected Pricing and Daily Pricing for NAV Oversight are typically pre-configured but an example is shown below.</p>
