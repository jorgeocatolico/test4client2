        <h1>Alternate Funding</h1>
        <p>Alternate Funding is always displayed on the cash forecast, even if there are no alternate cash forecast values. Only certain assets are identified as ‘alternate funding sources’ based on selection of the ‘Cash Forecasting Funding Source’ attribute. These assets are usually more liquid and may be used to cover a Fund Manager’s shortfall of cash, or to hold cash for periods of time.</p>

                    <h2>Redemptions</h2>
                    <p>A unit registry may receive $1m worth of redemptions on one day. These are passed through to the Fund Manager. The Fund Manager may choose to sell several assets of the fund in order to obtain the $1m cash needed to pay investors. Or the Fund Manager may have a cash account identified as an ‘alternate funding source’, and choose to redeem the whole $1m from this cash account given it is liquid.</p>
                    <p>The cash forecast table would therefore display -$1m cash movement under the relevant originator and counterparty combination.</p>
                    <h2>Applications</h2>
                    <p>A unit registry may receive $0.5m in applications in one day into a monthly priced fund. The fund is not due to be priced for another 25 days, so the Fund Manager may choose to deposit the money today into a cash account identified as an ‘alternate funding source’, and then move the money across to the monthly priced fund in 25 days’ time.</p>
                    <p>The cash forecast table would therefore display +$0.5m cash movement under the relevant originator and counterparty combination.</p>
