        <h1>Investment Summary </h1>
        <p>The Investment Summary displays one summary record  for each plan for each day that  has been processed.  The initial process is generated with a batch id of 1. If the process is requested subsequent times for the same entity on a , the batch id is incremented by one.  Results are shown separately, i.e. each one has a separate batch number. One summary record summarises all proposed transactions for a particular plan and effective date. These are displayed in the third panel of this view.</p>

                <p>Investment Summary rows travel along  <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term20">status streams</MadCap:glossaryTerm>, or life cycles. Most transitions between states are completed automatically by pControl. When certain states are reached, such as 'Exception', it is possible to manually transition the record to the next state.</p>
                <p>One or many Investment Summary records can be selected for simultaneous transition provided they are in the same state and are being transitioned to the same state.</p>
                <p>&#160;</p>
                <p>To transition Investment Summary rows:</p>
                <ol value="2" class="stepList" start="1">
                    <li class="stepList"> Select the required row or select the check boxes if there are multiple records to select. </li>
                    <li>
                        <p> Right click on one of the highlighted rows, and the available transitions will be displayed.</p>

                    </li>
