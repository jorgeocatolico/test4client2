        <h1>Automatic Reallocation of Entities in an Interfund Structure</h1>
        <p>If a proposed order has been changed at any level of an interfund structure, except the lowest level, it is possible to automatically generate new proposed orders i.e. without manually re-running the cash allocation process. </p>
        <div class="note_label">Note</div>
        <div class="note_content_short_width">
            <p>This is in pControl web only, as proposed ALRs do not recalculate upon selecting &lt;Update&gt; in Processing mode. In pControl web, the ALRs are recalculated upon selecting 'Commit'. </p>

            <p>If Plan A allocates AU$50,000 to Portfolio 1 and AU$50,000 to Portfolio 2, Portfolios 1 and 2 will generate proposed orders each totalling AU$50,000. The proposed orders will remain in a calculated state as the fund manager has discretion over the interfund structure. A different Portfolio Manager changes the proposed orders by allocating AU$25,000 to Portfolio 1 and AU$75,000 to Portfolio 2. As a result, the proposed orders from Portfolio 1 and Portfolio 2 need to be reallocated. The reallocation is initiated via the 'Reallocate' option on the master status stream.</p>
