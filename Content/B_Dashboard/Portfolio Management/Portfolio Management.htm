        <h1>Portfolio Management </h1>
        <p>Portfolio Management is a workbench supporting Cash Allocation and Rebalancing process (CAR). CAR is run in pControl's Processing Mode to establish start of day balances, or undertake rebalancing and distributing any incoming cash, or apportioning outgoing cash to/from underlying fund structures, which can consist of one or many entities in a hierarchy with unlimited tiers, and multiple currencies. The 'Proposed Transactions' generated by the CAR process are displayed in both Processing mode and in the third panel of the Portfolio Management workbench in the web view. These proposed transactions can be auto-approved when using CAR, to convert them into real orders.</p>
        <p>Portfolio Management allows additional functionality. The Proposed Transactions can be presented as a list, and they can also be viewed according to different classifications, such as orders grouped by asset class, geographic region or by custodian. Grouping orders by additional classification criteria allows validation checks to be performed to ensure compliance with any overarching business rules, such as ensuring investments remain within given limits across an asset class. The Portfolio Manager has the discretion to approve or adjust pControl's calculated proposed transactions, prior to the approval process. During the modelling process, any breaches of compliance will be highlighted, allowing further changes to be made before approving. Hard breaches cannot be overridden, while soft breaches may be approved with an override.</p>
