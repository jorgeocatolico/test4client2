        <h1>Data Manager</h1>
        <p>pControl Data Manager is used to facilitate inbound and outbound movement of data within pControl. It performs the task of data Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) from external or internal sources into pControl buffers for use in further internal processing or as a storage place, before being exported in various formats.</p>
        <p>The automated features of Data Manager include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data Monitoring:	Detection of data as it becomes available in defined locations, for use by pControl processes</li>
            <li>Take On: Loading data from external sources into pControl from file or database</li>
            <li>Data Enrichment: The preparation of import data for use by other processes</li>
            <li>Data Validation: Validation of data based on specified criteria</li>
            <li>Hand Off: Exporting of data from pControl to a file or another database</li>
            <li>Report Pack: The generation of a grouping of ‘Hand-Off’ reports</li>
        </ul>
