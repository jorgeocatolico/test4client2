        <h1>Product Master</h1>
        <p>The Product Master worktable is a framework that enables the creation, maintenance, export and dissemination of product master data. This data can include information related investment firms, investment strategies and investment vehicles. The table allows for maintenance and aggregation of product master data as it relates to a firm's investment strategies, investment managers and related investable products that are maintained in pControl. The worktable has dual authorisation enabled so that modifications to the underlying data are correctly managed. </p>
        <p>The Product Master worktable definition is maintained via the L080: Product Master, currently managed via the pControl System Administration module. Within pControl web, it is possible to add, delete and save investment strategies; as well as transitioning the record through the approval status stream. Additionally, within the worktable definition, product master fields can be defined to have editor type Worktable Tree Combo. Fields that have this editor type definition are maintain via the L081: Editor Options worktable in pControl web. </p>
