        <h1>U485: External Child Assets</h1>
        <p>The U485: External Child Assets worktable is used in conjunction with the U490: External Look-through worktable. The U490: External Look-through worktable stores the investment path details or risk factors for the direct assets of a Cash and Rebalancing (CAR) process. These are recorded as a set of external child assets and their weights within the direct asset. As the child assets do not exist in pControl, the U485: External Child Asset data load and associated process, first needs to be run in order to create these assets. This data is used by CAR for <MadCap:xref href="../../../B_Dashboard/Portfolio Management/Classifications/Classification Look-through.htm">Classification Look-through</MadCap:xref> when the look-through weights are externally supplied. </p>

                <p>The external child assets once created, are stored  in the allocation parameters and allocation records as a pControl id. With the mandatory fields being code and description, these are stored in a node id table, similar to how the classification sectors are stored with a unique node type. </p>
