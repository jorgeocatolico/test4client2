        <h1>Market Data</h1>
        <p>The Market data page displays the output of the Valuation processes run in pControl. </p>
        <p>Market data such as benchmarks, FX rates and Security prices (for securities not managed within pControl) are received into pControl from an external source. The valuation process provides a mechanism to load and validate this data before it is used in other processes and calculations. </p>
