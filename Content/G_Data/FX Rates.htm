        <h2 class="_orange">Internal FX Rates</h2>
        <p>pControl has the capability to receive FX rates from external vendors, an external investment management system or other external sources into the U178: FX Rates import worktable. FX rates are validated through a process called Valuation 1 process. Once validated, the FX rates are stored internally and pControl then generates all cross FX rates. </p>
        <p>Various pControl modules utilise the internal FX rates in their calculations (e.g. Orders, Reconciliations, NAV Control). </p>
        <p>To view the FX rates select Data &gt; FX Rates.</p>

            <p>When the date range to view FX rates is greater than 45 days, pControl will display a warning message and auto adjust the display date range to 45 days calculated from the 'To' date.</p>
