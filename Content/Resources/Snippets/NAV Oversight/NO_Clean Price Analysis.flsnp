        <p>The Share Class Impacts view, sometimes referred to as Clean Price Analysis or CPAS, provides a view across classes within the same fund to ensure their returns are moving in line with each other in an expected and predictable way. Classes of the same fund are not expected to have exactly the same price or return as each other, or the same price or return of the underlying pool for a given day because of the class specific factors that will impact a class return.</p>
