    <body>Will fail the test if a percentage of assets in the benchmark is not greater than the tolerance set, i.e., a specified % of the assets in the entity are present in the benchmark. This test ensures that the key benchmark being used is a good representation of the entityâ€™s assets. This is a validation that calculates a difference between two values and tests that % difference against the tolerances set for the validation.</body>
