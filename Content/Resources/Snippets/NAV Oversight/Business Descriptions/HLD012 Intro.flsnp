        <p>Will fail the test if the price of the asset has not moved from the previous pricing point (based on the holding records) unless the security has been flagged as infrequently priced through the L245 infrequently priced assets worktable.</p>
        <p>This validation is intended to check each holding record to ensure that the market price has changed from the previous pricing point.</p>
        <p>This is a true/false validation and either passes the test or fails â€“ there is no comparison to a tolerance, however a tolerance must be established in order to define the message to be output upon breach of the validation.</p>
