        <p>The validation allows for a value or sum of values delivered in one worktable for an entity to be compared to a value or sum of values delivered in another buffer for the same entity. This is to ensure that the data being delivered is consistent and conforms to known consistency checks.</p>
        <p>Validations for this test are configured in the static worktable L320: Generic Data Consistency Validations. </p>
        <p>Tolerances are configured in the L200: Tolerances worktable.</p>
