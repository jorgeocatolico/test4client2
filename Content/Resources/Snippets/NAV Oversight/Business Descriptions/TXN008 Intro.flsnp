        <p>For a transaction marked as a dividend, this will fail the test if the net base income generated from the dividend is greater than the tolerance set as a % of the entity's previous NAV/GAV.</p>
        <p>This validation is intended to check each transaction record to ensure that if the transaction represents a dividend payment (U200.ca_type set to ‘DIVIDEND’) then the base income on the transaction does not represent more than a specified percentage of the entity’s previous valuation.</p>
