        <p>Will fail the test if the exchange rate used on the transaction record is not equal (% tolerance) to the FX Rate stored within pControl.</p>
        <p>This validation is intended to check each transaction record to ensure that the FX Rate (exchange rate) delivered on the transaction record is consistent with that held in pControl - which should be the case for all transactions. </p>
        <p>This is a validation that calculates a difference between two values and tests that % difference against the tolerances set for the validation.</p>
