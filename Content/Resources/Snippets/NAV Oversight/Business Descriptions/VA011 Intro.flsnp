    <body>A Dynamic Composite Benchmark can be calculated for an Entity and this will create a benchmark based on the previous valuation point weights into underlying assets and the movement of a benchmark which is associated to the asset. This dynamic composite benchmark creates an alternative source of valuation movement which can be used to test the actual movement of the entityâ€™s value against.</body>
