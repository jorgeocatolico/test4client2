        <p>Will fail the test if there is a transaction present in the U200 worktable with no associated holding record in the U100 worktable unless all transactions into this asset sum to 0, i.e., there was a purchase and sale the same day.
</p>
        <p>
This validation is intended to check each transaction record to ensure that there is an associated holding record for the entity.
</p>
        <p>
This is a true/false validation and either passes the test or fails â€“ there is no comparison to a tolerance.
