        <p>The validation allows the comparison of two specific values for an entity which are retrieved from the field/worktable combinations specified. The comparison can be a straight $ difference between the values or a % difference which will be tested against the tolerance specified.
This test can ensure the consistency of data delivered for an entity where certain values delivered across different import worktable are known to be the same.
</p>
        <p>Validations for this test are configured in the static worktable L331: Generic Data Value.
