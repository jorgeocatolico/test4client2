        <h1>U580: Cash Allocation Proposed Orders Export</h1>
        <p>A new attribute has been added to the Cash Allocation process template, the [EX030] Export Cash Allocation Proposed Orders, shown below. When selected, the proposed orders are written to the U580: Cash Allocation Proposed Orders Export worktable once the CAR process has been run, and/or when the cash allocation process has been transitioned to an end state (Approved or Pending Completion). The proposed orders export can report all existing ALR fields.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The proposed orders that are written to the worktable, can be defined via the multi-select option on the processing entity, as shown below. When CAR processing runs, the ALRs that are in, or transitioned to any of the states defined on the entity will be exported to the worktable. </p>
