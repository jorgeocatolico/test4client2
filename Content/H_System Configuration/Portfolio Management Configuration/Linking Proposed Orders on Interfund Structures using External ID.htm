        <h1>Linking Proposed Orders on Interfund Structures using External ID</h1>
        <p>An External ID&#160;can be used in order to link proposed orders within interfund structures. The diagram below shows an interfund structure and how it is linked using the External ID. All ALRs within the structure have their own unique ALR ID, but they all share the same External ID that has been provided for the initial cashflow via the U110: Cashflows and Orders worktable. The External ID&#160;can be input or imported via the U110: Cashflows and Orders import workable and is available in both pControl Processing Mode and pControl Web Mode.</p>
        <p>If an External ID&#160;is not provided via the U110: Cashflows and Orders, pControl will generate a unique ID once the CAR process is run.</p>
